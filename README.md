Testbed / Vision for whatever Nimskull becomes, maybe. I need a faster way to
test some ideas.

# What ideas?

Motivation-wise from a programming language, I want to simply write/run a
function. This gets very complicated with sprawling frameworks, awkward
libraries, debugging, etc. Also maintenance is hard and getting help isn't easy
because the software ends up being very complex in it's implementation instead
of domain.

Whatever I end up with it should be a language where:

1. writing code geared towards revealing intention should be easy
2. the structure of the code should reveal operational behaviour
3. 1 & 2 must not cost a ton of performance; slow isn't fun
4. regular evolution of the language is a sustainable norm
5. solve problems end to end

Bets:
1. push heavily with structured/modular programming
2. the fundamental language must be explicit, the interface can ease the pain
3. static typing and analysis
4. compile time starts by building the program

(all this will evolve as time goes on)

## Syntax is a Work In Progress

While it's true that syntax is the interface and interfaces are very important,
that's not the focus as we can always 'reskin'. Instead, the abstract concepts
are the focus and must be nailed first and foremoast, while the syntax only
needs to hint at what it _could_ be.

Sticking with Nim inspired, as I like the lightness, but this might change if
parsing is a pain.
